           <p  class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-600"> Bioinformatics or computational biology is the use of information technology in the field of molecular biology or applying computer technology to biological research and management. Hereby computers are used to gather, store, analyze and merge biological information.

It is an emerging interdisciplinary research field and is progressively getting used to boost the standard of life. The ultimate goal of bioinformatics is to uncover the knowledge of biological data hidden in the mass and structure of sequence and develop clearer insight into the basic biology of organisms for using this information to reinforce the quality of life for the human race.

 </p>
          <p  class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-600"> It has boundless importance in the present era when we are dealing with molecules in the range of nano to femtometers. The hereditary information of an organism is encoded within the DNA. Genomics, the study of an organism’s entire genome is developed to understand the basic molecule of life which is known as the code of life. DNA is the entity that directly controls the biological makeup of any living organism. Understanding the structure of DNA has created wonderful success over several genetic disorders. It is variations and errors in the genomic DNA which ultimately outline the probability of developing diseases or resistance to the same disorders.</p>
          <p  class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-600"> Bioinformatics may have a profound impact in the lab as well as fields, ranging from, agriculture, biotechnology, human health, the environment, energy to advance medical analysis and development. It is getting used currently in the areas of molecular drugs to assist manufacture higher and a lot of customized medicines to prevent or cure diseases, it has environmental benefits in identifying waste cleanup microorganisms and in agriculture, it can be used for manufacturing high yield low maintenance crops. </p>

          <p  class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-600">The career prospects in the field of bioinformatics have further increased since the merging of information technology has taken place with molecular biology. Job prospects are everywhere ranging from biotechnology, hospitals, pharmaceutical, and biomedical sciences, research institutions till industry.</p>

          <p  class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-600">Bioinformatics Career Scope and Job prospects have become widespread after the merging of the information technology sector has taken place with that of molecular biology. Job prospects are in all sectors of biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and biomedical sciences, in research institutions, hospitals, and industry.

The work involved in the specific career areas are Characterisation of proteins and their interactions (Proteomics), Comparing genetic data between and within species (Genomics), Drug design utilizing 3-D structure modeling and computational chemistry (Cheminformatics), Genomic analysis in an attempt to find drug targets (Pharmacogenomics), Prediction of the function of genes and proteins based on sequence and structural data, etc.</p>
